WhereInTheWorld
===============

This repo contains my work for the WhereInTheWorld Assignment.

I discussed this assignment heavily with Ming as he helped me
work out many of the errors I was having during setup.

In addition, I talked to Simon Warchol about using the requestify module
for handling the redline portion of the project.

All aspects of this assignment have been correctly implemented.

I spent approximately 7 hours working on this assignment.
