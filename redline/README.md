Redline
=======

It is not possible to request the real-time data from MBTA using XMLHttpRequest,
because according to the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header of the response packet,
the JSON content is only available to pages with an origin of mbta.com.

This repo contains my redline lab. All aspects of this assignment have been correctly implemented.
I have not collaborated with anyone on this assignment.
