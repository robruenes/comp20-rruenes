Robert Ruenes' Comp20 Repo
==========================

This repository contains my coursework for Web Programming at Tufts, taught by Ming Chow during the Fall 2014 semester.

Out of all of my assignments, my favorite was assignment three. While I had done some client side JS work prior to taking this class, I had no previous experience with server-side programming and so assignment 3 was extremely valuable for me, as I learned about node.js, how to use services like heroku to set up web applications, how to hook up a mongo db instance locally and on a service like heroku, etc. These were all things that I had no clue about before this class and I really feel like I gained a lot out of that assignment.

I definitely feel like I've grown a lot since the first day of this course. I not only learned a lot, but even more so, learned how to teach myself, which is an invaluable skill.

I think the importance of making web apps secure is one of the things that was most important from this course. My web applications were full of security holes that got shown to me during the grading process of assignment 3. Additionally, during my Concurrency class this semester, I watched a team's demo get trashed by XSS attacks during the class that demonstrated how vulnerable the app was. Without this unit in the class, I don't think I would have gained the mindset of "I always need to think about security" when creating web applications, which I think will majorly benefit me in the long run - it would be a huge mistake on my part to deploy a web app with these kinds of security holes, and I'm glad that I know now that I always need to be thinking about these things.

Now that I'm done with the course, I definitely want to delve deeper into security as I haven't had any exposure until this class.
